## Hi everyone, I'm Bartek 👋

I'm an Electromechatronics student, passionate about technology and innovation, especially low-level programming in **Embedded Systems**.
I'm currently focusing on expanding my skills towards **Systems Engineering** and **safety-critical systems**, integrating hardware, software, and system-level design.
---

## My current projects:
- 🎓 **Bachelor Thesis** - Sliding Mode Control of a DC Motor based on **STM32F7** (ARM Cortex M7)
- 🧊 **Self-balancing cube** – early development stage, based on **ESP32**
- ⚡ **Oscilloscope** – measuring device based on **STM32G4** (ARM Cortex M4)
- 🛠 **System modeling experiments** – practicing **SysML/UML** for embedded

## Past (or rather unfinished 😅) projects:
- 🤖 **Waiter robot** – responsible for programming the **ESP32 controlling the drive system**
- 🤖 **MiniSumo robot** - based on **ATMega328P**
